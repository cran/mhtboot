Description: A framework for multiple hypothesis testing based on distribution
    of p values. It is well known that the p values come from different
    distribution for null and alternatives, in this package we provide
    functions to detect that change. We provide a method for using the change
    in distribution of p values as a way to detect the true signals in the
    data.
